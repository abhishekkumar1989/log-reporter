log-reporter
============

Trying to build a log reporter for mongo logs on hbase

Note : <br>
* This feature is build on top of HBase, so don't clone the repo until and unless you have HBase setup <br>
* For looking the UI please look : https://github.com/abhishekkumar1989/log-reporter-ui <br>
* Edit class HBaseConfig, for Hbase configuration <br>
* Snaps of UI : https://github.com/abhishekkumar1989/log-reporter-ui/wiki/snaps


This is just a learning exercise of HBase for me. But the features will keep on coming adding 
some meaningful information. Please request for new feature if you want.
