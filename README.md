log-reporter
============

Trying to build a log reporter for mongo logs on hbase

Note : 
1) This feature is build on top of HBase, so don't clone the repo until and unless you have HBase setup
2) For looking the UI please look : https://github.com/abhishekkumar1989/log-reporter-ui
3) Edit class HBaseConfig, for Hbase configuration


This is just a learning exercise of HBase for me. But the features will keep on coming adding 
some meaningful information. Please request for new feature if you want.
